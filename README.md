My journey has been a mix of coding, automating, and collaborating to create exceptional digital experiences. I'm all about making the software development world run like a well-oiled machine, I help teams collaborate better and deliver top-notch products, and I'm passionate about streamlining software development through DevOps practices, leveraging my diverse background to bring a unique perspective to the tech world. Also, my background in psychology enables me to bring a unique understanding of team dynamics and user experiences to my technical work.
